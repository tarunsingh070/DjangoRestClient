# DjangoRestClient
Django Rest Client is a very lightweight and easy to use utility tool for quickly testing Rest APIs directly from your mobile device anywhere and anytime.

Features:

* Make HTTP/HTTPS requests with the most commonly supported request types (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD and PATCH).

* Easily add new headers or edit existing ones with some commonly used pre-set headers types available for you to minimize your typing efforts.

* Quickly add/edit raw request body content for rest calls which need a request content to be sent along.

* Parses the HTTP response received and displays the Response code, Response body, Response time and Response headers in a user friendly and easy to understand format.

* Quickly COPY the response body received using the copy button to quickly share it with your peers to prove it's not your fault ;)

* Easily configure the Timeout Settings with configurable CONNECT, READ and WRITE timeout settings for testing your APIs.

* Use it to enhance your learning and understanding of Rest APIs.

* New features such as more supported request method types and request body types, more configuration options coming very soon.
